# Home Lab

## Objective

The goal of the home lab project is to create a flexible and controlled environment for learning and testing penetration techniques against Active Directory (AD) systems. This project aims to simulate real-world AD environments (and lazy admins), identify vulnerabilities, and practice common attack methodologies such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, and domain persistence. By doing so, I seek to deepen my understanding of Active Directory security, enhance my penetration testing skills, and develop effective defensive strategies to protect against AD-based threats.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of Active Directory misconfigurations, their exploitation, and securing AD through least privilege and auditing practices.
- In-depth understanding of Kerberos and NTLM authentication protocols and their associated risks.
- Ability to conduct penetration testing and identify vulnerabilities in Active Directory environments.
### Tools Used
**Tools Used but Not Limited To:**

- **Active Directory (AD)**
- **Metasploit**
- **Responder**
- **Impacket**
- **BloodHound**
- **Hashcat**
- **Mimikatz**
- **MITM6**
